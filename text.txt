welcome::You1
    You are an interdimensional traveller who have been jumping between
    worlds with your sibling.  Recently, you became separated, so you have
    more than idle curiosity driving you from world to world.

    You arrive in this world to find a snowed in village, devoid of
    any inhabitants.  You sense great evil, $(FOE), lurking ten floors
    below and only the retrieval of $(PRIZE) from the depths will restore
    balance to this realm.  While you hate to distract from the search for your
    sibling, you know they would expect you to help where you can.

    You have a wish stone you can throw to summon someone to join you
    in the quest.

    Press [F1] or [?] for keyboard help.

welcome::Back
    You return to your attempt to defeat $(FOE) and recover the $(PRIZE).

    Good luck!

fire::You
    Hey!  That is you on the other side of that portal!

# Game commands are the general overall commands.
game::help
    You are attempting to free the locals of this world from a dark
    evil.  And maybe find your sibling on the side.

    Put away your mouse!  This is keyboard only!

    You can move with the number pad, arrow keys + PgUp/Dn + Home/End,
    or with vi-style keys.  You can move and attack in 8 directions,
    but so can your foes.

       [q] - Elemental Burst
       [e] - Elemental Skill
       [r] - Range Attack
       [x] - Look Around
       [g] [,] - Pickup Item
       [ ] - Wait One Turn
       [c] [<] [>] - Climb
       [i] - Inventory
       [I] - Intrinsics
       [a] [s] [d] [f] - Switch Party Leader
       [Q] - Quit and Save
       [O] [Esc] - Options
       [?] [F1] - This Help


game::lose
    With the death of the last local, you have lost contact with
    this world.  This dimension is now doomed to fall under the
    dark sway of $(FOE).  You hope your sibling will understand
    your failure.

    Hit a key to try again.  There always is another version of
    this world in the multiverse that needs saving.

game::victory
    With the recovery of the $(PRIZE), this dimension will be safe.
    You can now move on to other dimensions in your quest to find
    your sibling.

    Congratulations!  You have won Rogue Impact!

    Hit a key to make another attempt on a fresh dimension.

victory::noheart
    This protected isle fills you with peace.  You have the feeling
    that if you could bring the source of corruption to this place,
    you could purify this world.

    Then, with this world saved, you could move on in search of your
    sibling with a clear conscience.

victory::heartchoice
    You bring $(PRIZE) onto the isle.  Its malignant magics pulse in
    response to the power of the spot.  You realize you have a choice.
    You can seal this evil away, protecting this world.  Or dig deeper
    into the evil, unlocking the next layer of horror.  Then, when
    you destroy that, the multiverse will be that much safer.

item::Running
    Given a clear path you can outpace most foes by breaking into
    a run.

item::Hasted
    Magical energies course through your veins, lending your movements
    speed.

item::Poisoned
    Toxic chemicals destroy your body from the inside.  If you can
    hold out long enough, you should eventually metabolize the poison
    and recover.

item::Resist
    You skin tingles and you have no fear of $(ELEMENT).

item::Vulnerable
    You feel it would be very wise to keep far from $(ELEMENT)!

item::Slow
    The very air feels thick as you struggle to move at a normal pace.

item::Sick
    You feel very ill.  You will heal slowly and be harmed more from
    injuries.

item::Blinded
    You cannot see.  You pray this is temporary.

item::Enraged
    You are enraged, unable to tell friend from foe.  Or maybe now
    you can finally tell, and they are all foes?

item::Regenerate
    Your wounds knit before your eyes as your body regenerates its
    injuries.

item::Invulnerability
    Nothing can touch you!  You are invincible!

item::potion of speed
    This energetic compound is filled with taurines, caffeines, and
    amphetamines to get you moving in the morning.

item::healing potion
    A magical brew of herbs and essential oils that will accelerate the
    healing process, closing wounds in minutes rather than days.

item::greater healing potion
    Dangerous alchemical research led to the concentration of the
    healing potion into this potent brew.  It can take someone at
    Death's Gate and get them ready for combat in just one swig.

item::vial of acid vulnerability
    The esters in this substance have been formulated to catalyse
    the hydrolysis reactions that enable acids to eat through flesh.

item::oil of acid resistance
    This oil forms a protective sacrificial layer, preventing the
    target from being harmed by acids.

item::bottle of acid
    The thickly stoppered bottle contains a powerful concentrated
    acid.  Safety goggles and gloves must be worn while handling it!

item::poison potion
    The exact method by which this liquid inflicts devastating
    internal damage isn't known.  But you don't have to understand
    how it works to know why you shouldn't drink it.

item::cure potion
    A mixture of numerous anti-toxins and anti-venoms, this snake
    oil is reputed to be able to cure everything but the common
    cold.

item::red potion
    A vial of thick viscous red fluid that reminds you of clotted blood.

item::yellow potion
    It is a truth universally acknowledged, that an adventurer in
    possession of a yellow potion, must be in want of healing.

    So drink up!  It must be a healing potion.

item::green potion
    A vile smelling greenish substance clings to the wall of this bottle.

item::blue potion
    A translucent blue liquid with a surprisingly high index of refraction.
    Perhaps if it could be rendered more transparent, one could use it
    to produce some form of adaptive optics?  But in this time, drinking
    or throwing are the choices.

item::purple potion
    The violet hue of this potion recalls the colour of kobolds, making
    you wary of ingesting it.

item::white potion
    An optically thick potion containing a liquid of surprisingly low
    density.  You almost could believe it was filled by a gas rather than a
    fluid if judging by weight.

item::glowing potion
    Some ongoing reaction is causing this potion to shed a cold light.
    Maybe if you drink enough of it, you could glow too?

item::cyan potion
    A rich saturated cyan solution fills this flask.

item::ruby ring
    A copper ring with a well-cut ruby glittering in the setting.

item::sapphire ring
    A brilliant blue saphire adorns this ring.  You wonder briefly
    if Ba'zlbub cast his spell on this gem, for you seem to have great
    difficulty in spelling it properly.

item::gold ring
    A plain gold ring, fortuitously already sized to one of your fingers.
    With the current price of gold, you'd hate to have to pay for a resizing!

item::amethyst ring
    A wondrous purple amethyst is the center piece of this ring.  You wonder
    if this world still considers amethyst a precious stone, as its beauty
    deserves, or if the cold calculating hand of macroeconomics has reduced it
    to mere semi-precious stature?

item::diamond ring
    This ring is studded with small, but well cut, diamonds.  Perfect
    for scratching glass, so something to be careful of.

item::ring of acid resist
    This ring has a rather basic design which would be rejected by
    a discerning fashionista.  But that is just the thing to fend off
    acids!

item::ring of ice resist
    The ring emits a warm glow that keeps your fingers and toes toasty
    even in the worst winter weather.

item::ring of fire resist
    A slight chill from the ring alerts you that it is hungry for heat
    and will redirect fire to itself, reducing the amount that
    scorches you.

item::ring of poison resist
    This ring chaffs at your finger, but does so as it is continuously
    injecting the chemicals required to mitigate the effect of poison.

item::ring of electric resist
    The rubber ring proves its insulating properties by grounding you
    from electric shocks.  Okay, that is a contradiction in effects,
    but magic is always a balance of antipathy and sympathy.  If it
    were logical, it wouldn't be magic!

item::heart of Baezl'bub
    The ice cold blackened heart of the demon that tormented this
    realm.  You must now find a place to exorcise its vile magic
    and restore this world to peace.

item::corpse
    The crumpled remains of a vanquished foe.  Might be good eating
    on this, if you were hungry enough.

item::body
    Your eyes blur, tears springing unbidden.  Let not this sacrifice
    be in vain!

item::wish stone
    This fist-sized rock glows a pleasing blue.  It is attuned to
    astral energies and can pull the spirit of a being still closely
    tied to this plane to aid you in your quest.

    The activation is trivial: throw it, and an ally will be summoned
    where it lands.

item::portal stone
    A hefty rock that glows with an orange energy.  You can sense it
    is imbued with the sort of dimensional energy that allowed you to
    cross between worlds - it likely can be used to open a portal
    within this world given the right location.  You probably need to
    throw it at a thick wall where the energy can stabilize.

death::New Party
    No one has returned from the dungeon.
    
    Those in the village decide to form a new party to find out what happened.
    Or end the threat themselves.

death::Another Chance
    As $(MOB) falls to the ground, dead, they begin to glow from within.
    The glow brightens and envelopes them.  When it recedes, they have
    been restored to full health and are ready to continue on the quest.

mob::rat
    The cowardly rat scurries away from you.  Pesky dungeon nuisances,
    you should corner it and dispatch it.  After all, how dangerous
    could a cornered rat be?

mob::tridude
    A three legged green alien stares at you from its top mounted
    triplex of eyes.  You cannot discern the alien intent behind its
    non-expression; but experience suggests it does not plan on being
    your friend.

mob::kobold ice archer
    This purple-furred humanoid has used its low wit to devise an
    ice-infused bow that it uses to strike you from afar with ice
    arrows.

mob::kobold fire archer
    Some research into kobolds claim that they are unintelligent and
    have not mastered the art of fire.  Those researchers should
    update their notes, for this kobold has a fire-infused bow that
    they are using with great skill.

mob::kobold poison archer
    The dog-sized kobold is the vermin of dungeons. At least until
    they acquire a ranged weapon.  This one has poisoned its arrows
    to ensure your day does not end well.

mob::kobold acid archer
    The exact source of these kobolds supply of acid is not known.
    Some suspect the milk of captive slugs.  Others ascribe the source
    to secret chemical knowledge.  You just wish the acid arrows didn't
    hurt so much.

mob::kobold shock archer
    A geared mechanism allows this kobold to spin some rabbit fur on
    an amber arrowhead at great speed.  The resulting arrow is
    charged with electric force sufficient to knock back a horse.

mob::fire slug
    This slow moving slug is engulfed in flames.  The flames do not
    seem to burn it, but actually be part of it.

mob::ice slug
    Slugs are thought of as soft and organic, but the ice slug has
    crystalized into hard planes and edges, making for a beautiful,
    if dangerous, creature.

mob::acid slug
    The very rocks the slug slimes across hiss and vaporise with the
    intensity of the slugs acid.  It is known slugs hate snails for
    their shells, but to go to such lengths to reject calcium
    carbonate?  It shows dedication.

mob::poison slug
    A single touch by this slug is enough to imbue a toxic collection
    of poisons.  The bright green colour is to warn off predators.
    So why then is it chasing you?  Does that mean you are naught but
    prey to its eyestalks?

mob::zap slug
    This purple slug crackles with undischarged electric potential.
    Its slime has been harvested to produce capacitors due to its
    impressive dielectric constant.  Interesting trivia that doesn't
    make the shock of making contact any more pleasant.

mob::Beezlbub
    Baez'lbub is most famous for casting a spell to make him
    impervious to magic.  It was not quite successful, and just made
    him impervious to spelling, so no one, not even the demon himself,
    can spell Bae'zlbub's name correctly.

mob::avatar
    Your corporeal shell for adventuring in this realm. Treat it well!

death::avatar
    Your avatar falls to the ground, dying:

    I have done what I can for this universe.  The people here will
    have to complete the quest without me.  I shall move on in my search
    for my sibling.

chat::avatar
    Your avatar speaks:

    I came to this village to search for my sibling.  I found it empty,
    but a great evil was nearby.  I hope to recruit locals from this
    universe to eliminate the evil so I can go search for my sibling
    knowing this realm is safe.

mob::Kor Smith
    A heavily muscled blacksmith who ran the village's forges before
    the evil fell.

death::Kor Smith
    Kor Smith collapses to the ground.

    I knew I should not have left the safety of the forge.  I only
    hope this work unfinished can be finished by another.

chat::Kor Smith
    Kor Smith speaks wearily:

    I'd rather be at my forge constructing tools to ease our harvest.
    But these desperate times may require me to wield my hammer for
    destruction rather than creation.  Let me know if you need me
    on your side!  Unless there are rats.  Then you can leave me
    behind.

mob::Eliza Smith
    Kor's wife, who would be quite annoyed at being described only
    in relation to her husband, as she has her own unique and interesting
    backstory.  Ironically, Smith was her maiden name as well.

death::Eliza Smith
    Eliza Smith exhales her last breath.

    I have done what was right, so while I wished to see the world
    freed of this evil, I have no regrets.

chat::Eliza Smith
    Eliza Smith speaks sternly:

    Someone has to do something about the great evil below.  And
    if I've learned one thing, there is no point waiting for "someone"
    to step up.  Consider myself "someone" and let me know where
    to help out.

mob::Farmer Joe
    It requires hard work and intelligence to be a successful farmer
    in this remote village.  So why, instead of all those farmers, was it Joe
    who answered the call of the wish stone?

death::Farmer Joe
    Farmer Joe staggers and falls to the earth.

    Damnit!  This is what I git for messin' with thin's I needn't have
    messed with!

chat::Farmer Joe
    Farmer Joe speaks with alcohol laden breath:

    Why we have to be pokin' at these tunnels?  Can't we sit
    back and sip something warming by the fire?  But if you wanna
    go pokin', ol' Joe can poke some holes in any foe ya fear!

    *hic*

    Don't worry, the drink steadies my aim.

mob::Timmy
    Eliza and Kor's son, Timmy is supposed to become a blacksmith.  He'd
    rather be exploring the woods and feeding pigeons.

death::Timmy
    The small body of Timmy falls and bleeds out.

    NoooO!!  This is not fun!!  I wanna go home!

chat::Timmy
    Timmy speaks with the high tenor of youth:

    Evil undead!  Chaotic Slimes!  Let me at them, I'll show them the
    one-two Timmy attack!  Way better than hitting metal in a dark
    forge at least.

mob::Rodney Baker
    Debbie's husband, who takes the term husband seriously as his job is
    to husband the village's grain supplies.  He first found the mold that
    presaged the end of the town.

death::Rodney Baker
    Rodney Baker breathes his last.

    Go on... Each of us must do our part...  So long as the evil is cleansed
    my death will not be in vain.

chat::Rodney Baker
    Rodney Baker speaks worriedly:

    Something has turned our food supplies.  I think the source is the
    evil that has opened into our peaceful valley.  Please let me aid
    in the cleansing of this evil.

mob::Debbie Baker
    The town baker whose bread's fame brings people from afar.

death::Debbie Baker
    Debbie Baker crumples into a heap, her last energies spent.

    Now I think I know what yeast feels like when it is placed in the oven.
    If it is our time to rise, we'll rise.  But it seems it is not time
    for me.

chat::Debbie Baker
    Debbie Baker speaks with resignation:

    I can't bake bread without good flour.  So until the evil that
    taints our flour is fixed, I might as well join you in the fixing!

mob::T'losh
    An undead lich who was largely blamed for an evil that befell
    the world.  And usually is guilty thereof.  In this case something
    deeper is at work, and T'losh does not appreciate competition for
    the most evil person in the world.

death::T'losh
    T'losh's body vibrates and vanishes, but not before a last word.

    Bah, this weak form has failed me.  Back to the phylactery!

chat::T'losh
    T'losh speaks, disdain dripping with each syllable:

    Petty humans, still clinging to the rituals of eating and
    defecating.  My necromantic servants are free of such constraints,
    you should join them!  But in any case, this is all a distraction
    to my research so I'll be willing to aid you in dealing with the
    vermin.

mob::Treska
    Treska of the Seven Alphabets is famed through the multiverse for
    her erudite knowledge.  But her prudish character means she has
    few friends.  It is rumoured she was involved with impropriety on
    her home world that sent her wandering the multiverse.  It is also
    rumoured the impropriety was holding hands out of wedlock.

death::Treska
    Treska shimmers and fades away.

    Thank you for the excellent data!  Seems like my connection here has
    weakened too much.  It has been fun, so please ask me again!

chat::Treska
    Treska attempts to speak down to your level:

    Such an interesting study potential!  The opportunities to learn
    from this rift cannot be understated.  It is unfortunate that the
    denizens seem uniformly hostile, I'd love to make contact.

    But I'd really like to collect any data I can, so let me know
    how I can help the party.

mob::Elder Krall
    The ancient elder of the village.  When things go wrong, he was always
    the last to go investigate.  But usually he got the job done.

death::Elder Krall
    The elder falls prone, his breath failing.

    It is time to pass the torch to the next generation.  I've attempted to
    record my wisdom in books; so I hope you will read them now that I'm not
    around to lecture!

chat::Elder Krall
    The village elder, Krall, dispenses his wisdom:

    As the town's elder it is my role to remember what went before so
    we can avoid the mistakes of yesteryear.  There really are no
    priors for this sort of problem, however.  The closest I recall
    was an apocryphal tale of folks trapped in a village like this.
    I recall the solution then was violence.  I fear that is the
    solution this time too.  While I do not enjoy engaging in the
    last refuge of the incompetent, select my place and I will aid.

mob::Al'kami
    A merchant who commonly frequented the village.  Her chemical wares
    were of great demand, especially by Debbie who would use them to
    augment her baking.  Baking is just applied chemistry, after all.

death::Al'kami
    Al'kami speaks her last words:

    It seems I shall not be saving this village...  I will
    miss Debbie's baking.  Made the journey here profitable despite
    what my accountant kept telling me.

chat::Al'kami
    The merchant, Al'kami, speaks:

    I often visited this town, when the pass was not snowed in, to
    sell my various compounds and mixtures.  To see it under the
    influence of evil is disheartening - my future profits are in
    jeopardy!  I shall use my chemical mixtures to set things astraight.
